HI EVERYBODY

This is a short and simple example for tutorial purpose and it explaines how to create a Singleton and How to work with different call back mechanisms. This is totally for newbies who have started working on iOS applications but after a point they are not able to move fast.

This simple example will explain 5 things. 

1. How to create a singleton.
2. How to create a protocol.
3. How to use delegate for callback.
4. How to use block for callback.
5. How to use Key Value Observation for callback.

Other than these things it will explain how to use singleton efficiently with callbacks.

This code is totally free and any one can use it for any purpose.

Thank You
